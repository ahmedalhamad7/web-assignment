    <h1>Type 2 Diabetes</h1>
    <p>Type 2 diabetes is characterized by a malfunction in the way the body
      controls and utilizes sugar (glucose) as a fuel. This long-term (chronic)
       disorder causes an excess of sugar to circulate in the circulation.
       High blood sugar levels can eventually cause cardiovascular,
       neurological, and immunological system problems.</p>


    <p>
      There are basically two connected issues at work in type 2 diabetes.
      Your pancreas does not create enough insulin, a hormone that regulates
      the transport of sugar into your cells, and your cells respond poorly
      to insulin, allowing you to consume less glucose.

      <h2>Symptoms of type 2 Diabetes</h2>
      <h4>Type 2 diabetes symptoms can appear gradually.
         In fact, you can have type 2 diabetes for years without
         realizing it. When there are signs and symptoms, they may include: </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Fatigueness</li>
            <li>Tingling and numbness in hands or feet</li>
            <li>Unintenional weight loss</li>
            <li>Blurred vision</li>
            <li>Wounds and sores heal slowly </li>
            <li>An increase in hunger and thirst</li>
          </ul>
<hr>
      <h2>Causes of type 2 Diabetes</h2>
      <p>Type 2 diabetes is caused mostly by two interconnected issues:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Insulin resistance develops in muscle, fat, and liver cells.
         These cells do not take up enough sugar because they do not interact
         normally with insulin.</li>
       <li>The pancreas is unable to generate enough insulin to keep blood
         sugar levels under control.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>
     The exact reason of why this happens is not known, but some factors,such as,
     being inactive and overweight can contribute heavily.
     </p>
<hr>
     <h3>Some factors increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Being overweight</li>
        <li>Inactivity: Physical activity helps in controlling your weight and
          making the cells in your body more responsive to insulin. This is why
        the less active you are the higher the risk.</li>
        <li>Age: Risk of type 2 diabetes increases with age, after the age of 35
        especially.</li>
        <li>Prediabetes: If prediabetes is left untreated it would develop into
        type 2 diabetes.</li>
        <li>Family history: If a sibling or a parent has type 2 diabetes, the \
        risk of it increase.</li>
      </ul>

<hr>
     <h2>The complications of type 2 Diabetes</h2>
     <p>Type 2 diabetes affects several main organs, including the heart, blood
       vessels, nerves, kidneys and eyes. <br/>
    Type 2 Diabetes consequences and common comorbidities include:
    </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Slow healing: Cuts and blisters, if left untreated, can develop into
      dangerous infections that heal slowly. Severe damage may need amputation
      of a toe, foot, or leg.</li>
    <li>Hearing impairment</li>
    <li>Dementia: Type 2 diabetes appears to raise the risk of Alzheimer's
      disease and other dementia-causing illnesses. Poor blood sugar regulation
      has been related to a more faster decrease in memory and other mental skills.</li>
    <li>Nerve damage in the limbs: Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage
       or kill nerves, causing tingling, numbness, burning, pain, or eventual
       loss of sensation, which generally starts at the ends of the toes or
       fingers and progressively travels higher.</li>
       <li>Kidney disease: Diabetes can cause chronic renal disease or
         irreversible end-stage kidney failure, requiring dialysis or a kidney
         transplant.</li>
         <li>Eye damage: Diabetes raises the risk of major eye illnesses
           including cataracts and glaucoma, and it can damage the blood vessels
            in the retina, potentially leading to blindness.</li>
          <li>Heart and blood vessel disease: Diabetes is linked to an increased
             risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and blood
             vessel constriction (atherosclerosis).</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Treatment for type 2 Diabetes</h3>
<p>Type 2 diabetes has no cure, although decreasing weight, eating healthily,
  and exercising can help you manage the illness. If food and exercise aren't
  enough to keep your blood sugar under control, you may require diabetic
  medication or insulin therapy.</p>

<h2>Prevention of type 2 Diabetes</h2>
<p>Healthy lifestyle choices can help avoid type 2 diabetes, especially if you
  have biological relatives who have the disease. If you have prediabetes,
  lifestyle adjustments can help to halt or stop the progression to diabetes.
<br/>Healthy lifestyle includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A healthy diet</li>
  <li>Being active and exercising</li>
  <li>Losing weight, if you are overweight</li>
</ul>
