    <h1>What is Diabetes?</h1>
    <p>Diabetes is a long-term health issue that affects how your body converts
       food into energy.
The majority of the food you consume is converted into sugar (glucose) by your
 body and released into your circulation. When your blood sugar rises, your
  pancreas sends a signal to release insulin. Insulin functions like a key,
  allowing blood sugar to enter cells and be used as energy.
Diabetes occurs when your body does not produce enough insulin or does not
utilise it as well as it should. Too much blood sugar remains in your circulation
 when there is insufficient insulin or when cells cease reacting to insulin. This
  can lead to major health issues such as heart disease, eyesight loss, and renal
   disease over time.</p>

        <h3>Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
        <p>An autoimmune response is assumed to be the etiology of type 1 diabetes
          (the body attacks itself by mistake). This response prevents your body
          from producing insulin. Type 1 diabetes affects around 5-10% of all
          diabetics. Type 1 diabetes symptoms can appear fast. It is most
          commonly diagnosed in children, teenagers, and young adults.
          To survive if you have type 1 diabetes, you must take insulin every day.
           At the moment, no one understands how to prevent type 1 diabetes.</p>

        <h3>Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
        <p>In the case of type 2 diabetes, your body does not utilise insulin
          properly and cannot maintain normal blood sugar levels. Type 2
          diabetes affects 90-95% of diabetics. It takes several years to
          develop and is generally diagnosed in adulthood (but more and more in
          children, teens, and young adults). Because you may not notice any
          symptoms, it is critical to have your blood sugar tested if you are
          at risk.</p>
             </div>

        <h3>Gestational Diabetes</h3>
        <p>Gestational Diabetes usually develops in pregnant women who have
          never had Diabetes. If you have gestational diabetes, your baby may
          be more vulnerable to health concerns. Gestational diabetes normally
          disappears once the baby is born. However, it raises your chances of
          developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Your child is more likely
          to be overweight as a child or adolescent and to acquire type 2
          diabetes later in life.</p>

      <h2>What is prediabetes?</h2>
      <p>Prediabetes occurs when sugar levels are higher than usual, but not
         high enough to be diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes. In the US, prediabetes
       affects 96 million individuals, accounting for more than one-third of all
        adults, and more than 8 out of 10 are not aware that they have it.
        Prediabetes increases your chances of developing type 2 diabetes,
        heart disease, and stroke.</p>
