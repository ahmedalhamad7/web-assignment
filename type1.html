      <h1>Type 1 Diabetes</h1>
      <p>Type 1 Diabetes is a chronic illness that was formerly classified
      as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent. The pancreas produces little or
      no insulin in this situation. Insulin is a hormone produced by the human body
      that allows glucose to enter the cells and create energy.</p>

      <h2>Symptoms of type 1 Diabetes</h2>
      <h4>Type 1 Diabetes symptoms might appear unexpectedly and iclude: </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Increase in Urination</li>
            <li>Feeling thirstier than usual</li>
            <li>Rapid weight loss without diet or exercise</li>
            <li>Mood swings</li>
            <li>Tiredness and weakness</li>
            <li>Blurry vision</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Causes of type 1 Diabetes</h2>
      <p>Type 1 diabetes has an unknown etiology. The insulin-producing cells in
         the pancreas are usually destroyed by the body's own immune system,
         which ordinarily battles dangerous germs and viruses. Some other possible
       causes involve:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Genetics may play a role</li>
         <li>Being exposed to viruses and other situational factors</li>
       </ul>

     <h3>Seriousness of type 1 Diabetes and complications</h3>
     <p>Type 1 diabetes complications can impact key organs in the body over
       time. The heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes, and kidneys are among these
        organs. A normal blood sugar level can reduce the risk of a variety of
         problems. Examples of these complications:
         </p>
       <ul>
         <li>Heart and vascular disease: Diabetes raises the risk of certain
           heart and blood vessel disorders. Coronary artery disease with chest
           discomfort (angina), heart attack, stroke, arterial constriction
           (atherosclerosis), and high blood pressure are examples.</li>
          <li>Nerve damage: a huge increase in blood sugar injures the walls of
          tiny blood vessels that feed the nerves, especially in the legs, which
        causes numbness, tingling or pain. This commonly starts at the tips of
        the toes or fingers and works its way up. Poor blood sugar management
        may lead you to lose all sensation in the afflicted limbs over time. </li>
        <li>Eye damage: Diabetes can cause blood vessel damage in the retina.
          This might result in blindness. Diabetes also raises the chance of
          developing other major eye problems, such as cataracts and glaucoma.</li>
          <li>Kidney damage: Millions of small blood capillaries in the kidneys
             prevent waste from entering the bloodstream. Diabetes has the
             potential to harm this system. Severe damage can result in renal
             failure or end-stage kidney disease that is irreversible.
             End-stage renal disease requires artificial filtration of the
             kidneys (dialysis) or a kidney transplant. </li>
       </ul>

     <h3>The management of type 1 Diabetes</h3>
     <p>The management of type 1 diabetes can be difficult, but maintaining a healthy
     lifestyle would impact it hugely, exercising and having a balanced healthy
   diet would help a lot.</p>
   <p>Right now there is no known cure for type 1 diabetes. The only treatment
   is the use of insulin. Insulin can be administered using two main ways:
 </p>
 <ol>
   <li>Injecting the insulin via needles or insulin pens</li>
   <li>Using an insulin pump</li>
 </ol>
